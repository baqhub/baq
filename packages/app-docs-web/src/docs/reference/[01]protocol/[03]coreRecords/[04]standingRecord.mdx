# Standing Record

Track the standing of another user with the author.

```json
{
  "publisher": {...},
  "decision": "allow"
}
```

{props.toc}

## Reference

### `StandingRecord`

A private [Record](01735953) to let the author's server know how to handle new content coming from another user.

#### Properties

<props.properties>

- **`publisher`** <props.pill href="fa939df0">EntityLink</props.pill>

  - User this Standing record applies to.

- **`decision`** <props.pill>enum</props.pill>

  - Current standing with the author.

  - Possible values:

    - `allow` : Allow incoming content from this user.

    - `block` : Block incoming content from this user.

</props.properties>

#### Notes

- There can only be one Standing record for a given publisher.

- Apps need to explicitly request permission to update the decision.

- A Standing record with an `allow` decision is automatically created when the author first interacts with another user, if one didn't already exist.

- If no Standing record exists for a given user, incoming records from that user will have a `notification_unknown` [source](01735953#record).

## Examples

### Block decision Standing record

This is what the content of a Standing record might look like.

```json
{
  "publisher": {
    "entity": "bob.baq.run"
  },
  "decision": "block"
}
```
