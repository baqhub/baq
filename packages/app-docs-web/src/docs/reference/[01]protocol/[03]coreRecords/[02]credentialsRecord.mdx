# Credentials Record

## Reference

### `CredentialsRecord`

A private [Record](01735953) to store a public and private key pair. This is then used to sign and authenticate requests and responses from app to server and server to server.

#### Properties

<props.properties>

- **`algorithm`** <props.pill>enum</props.pill>

  - Signing algorithm to use with these credentials.

    - `ed25519`: Only algorithm currently supported.

- **`target`** <props.pill href="6fda79e8">RecordLink</props.pill> _unique_

  - Record authenticated by these credentials (e.g. [app](02acb69c), [relationship](d15903e4)).

- **`target_public_key`** <props.pill>string</props.pill>

  - Base64 encoded public key of the other party.

- **`public_key`** <props.pill>string</props.pill>

  - Base64 encoded public key.

- **`private_key`** <props.pill>string</props.pill>

  - Base64 encoded private key.

</props.properties>

#### Notes

- The `target_public_key` is provided by the other party to validate the signature of incoming payloads from the other side of the communication channel.

- A Credentials record is always private and only visible to its author.

- The only supported signing algorithm at the moment is [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/index.html).

- Credential records are automatically created by the server when receiving new [App](02acb69c) or [Relationship](d15903e4) records.
