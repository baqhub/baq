# Entity Link

Reference a user within the BAQ network.

```json
{
  "entity": "pierre.baq.run"
}
```

{props.toc}

## Reference

### `EntityLink`

This object can appear both within the record envelope (e.g. `author`) and record content, depending on the record type.

#### Properties

<props.properties>

- **`entity`** <props.pill href="deae588f#entity">Entity</props.pill>

  - Entity currently representing the target user.

- **`original_entity`** <props.pill href="deae588f#entity">Entity</props.pill> _optional_

  - Target user's entity at the time the record version was created, if different.

</props.properties>

## Examples

### Link to user on different server

A link can be to a BAQ user on any compatible server, identified by their entity.

```json
{
  "entity": "julie.freebaq.org"
}
```

### Link to user who changed entity

When a user changes entity, the entity that was active at the time of the record version creation is returned as the `original_entity`. This allows clients and servers to validate a record's `version_hash`.

```json
{
  "entity": "pierre.baq.run",
  "original_entity": "pierre.baqtest.dev"
}
```
