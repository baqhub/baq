## Reference

### `RecordLink`

This object can appear both within the record envelope (e.g. `app`) and record content, depending on the record type.

#### Properties

<props.properties>

- **`entity`** <props.pill href="deae588f#entity">Entity</props.pill>

  - Current entity representing the target record's initial author.

- **`original_entity`** <props.pill href="deae588f#entity">Entity</props.pill> _optional_

  - Entity that represented the target record's initial author at the time the referencing record version was created, if different.

- **`record_id`** <props.pill href="deae588f#recordid">RecordId</props.pill>

  - Unique identifier of the record within the scope of its initial author.

</props.properties>

## Examples

### Link to record on different server

A link can be to a record on any compatible server, identified by the author's entity.

```json
{
  "entity": "julie.freebaq.org",
  "record_id": "2758ee128ec245ffb783216fcf3ada14"
}
```

### Link with new record author entity

When a user changes entity, the entity that was active at the time of the referencing record version creation is returned as the `original_entity`. This allows clients and server to validate a record's `version_hash`.

```json
{
  "entity": "pierre.baq.run",
  "original_entity": "pierre.baqtest.dev",
  "record_id": "652093513e40443ca9377e660269c3b5"
}
```
