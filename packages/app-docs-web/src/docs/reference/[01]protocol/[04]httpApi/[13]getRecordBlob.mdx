# GET record_blob

Get a single blob from a record.

```httpcli
GET https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}/blobs/{blob_hash}/{file_name}
```

{props.toc}

## Reference

### Request

A blob can only be downloaded through a record that has a [Blob link](70af90d6) to it.

Build the request URL by replacing the following variables in the `record_blob` endpoint URL template:

- `{entity}` and `{record_id}`: Record that links to the blob.

- `{blob_hash}`: Hash of the blob to download.

- `{file_name}`: File name of the blob within the record. This is useful when the same blob might appear multiple times in the same record under different names and content types.

#### Headers

<props.properties>

- **`Range`** <props.pill>string</props.pill> _optional_

  - Part of the blob that should be returned.

  - Only supports single byte ranges.

</props.properties>

### Response

The blob to download is the sole content of the response.

#### Headers

<props.properties>

- **`Content-Length`** <props.pill>int</props.pill>

  - Size of the blob in bytes.

- **`Content-Type`** <props.pill>string</props.pill>

  - Content type of the blob link for the requested file name.

- **`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename={file_name}`**

  - Requested file name.

- **`Cache-Control`** <props.pill>string</props.pill>

  - Depends on the record permissions:

    - Public record: 1 year private, 2h shared.
    - Private record with standard authentication: 1 year private.
    - Private record with bearer token: bearer validity (max 2h), shared.

- **`Content-Range`** <props.pill>string</props.pill> _optional_

  - Part of the blob being returned.

  - Only for requests with a `Range` header.

</props.properties>

## Usage

### Download a blob

We get a single `hello.txt` blob that was linked in one of our user's records.

```http
GET /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87/blobs/66a045b452102c59d840ec097d59d9467e13a3f34f6494e539ffd32c1bb35f18/hello.txt HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

The response includes a `Content-Disposition` header so that browsers know how to name the file after downloading it.

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Length: 6
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=hello.txt
Cache-Control: max-age=6309262, s-maxage=7200, immutable

Hello\n
```
