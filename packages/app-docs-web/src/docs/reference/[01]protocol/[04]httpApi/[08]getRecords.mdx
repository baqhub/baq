</props.properties>

### Filter

A filter is a comma-separated list of conditions.

Conditions apply to the following record properties:

<props.compactList>

- `id`

- `source`

- Any link property (e.g. `$['author']`).

</props.compactList>

Conditions can have one of three different formats:

- **`$['path']=`**: The record should have no value at that path.

- **`$['path']=value`**: The record should have the specified value at that path.

- **`value`**: The record should have at least one link with the specified value.

Condition values have a specific format depending on their value:

- **`entity`**: Entity link.

- **`entity+record_id`**: Record link.

- **`entity+record_id+version_hash`**: Version link.

- **`"value"`**: Tag link.

Conditions at the top level are combined using the `AND` operator. Parentheses can be used to create more advanced conditions: each level of grouping flips the operator. For example:

- **`c1,c2`**: `c1 AND c2`

- **`c1,(c2,c3)`**: `c1 AND (c2 OR c3)`

- **`c1,(c2,(c3,c4))`**: `c1 AND (c2 OR (c3 AND c4))`

### Response

#### Content

<props.properties>

- **`records`** <props.pill href="01735953">Records[]</props.pill>

  - Resulting list of records.

- **`linked_records`** <props.pill href="01735953">Records[]</props.pill>

  - Linked records requested with `include_links`.

- **`next_page`** <props.pill>string</props.pill> _optional_

  - Query string to fetch the next page of results.

  - Empty if this is the end of the requested range.

</props.properties>

## Usage

### List first 30 records

Without any filter, the `records` endpoints will return all the records the requester has access to. Here we specify the `page_size` to retrieve the first 30.

```http
GET /api/alice/records?page_size=30 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

Because this queries all records without filter, we get a `next_page` to let us easily paginate over the results.

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "records": [...],
  "linked_records": [...],
  "next_page": "?page_size=30&page_start=%222023-12-15T11:20:01.2240000Z%22"
}
```

### Filter by type and author

Querying all records is rarely useful, instead we may want add a filter to only get records of a specific type. Here we add a filter for [Post records](d1f9da17#post) created by the user with entity `cyril.baq.run`.

```http
GET /api/alice/records?filter=$['type']=types.baq.dev+6ee7f69a90154b849bac528daa942bcd,$['author']=cyril.baq.run HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

In this case, because only a small number of records match this filter, it is the only page and we don't get a `next_page` property.

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "records": [...],
  "linked_records": [...]
}
```
