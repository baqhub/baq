# DELETE record

Delete a single record.

```httpcli
DELETE https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}
```

{props.toc}

## Reference

### Request

The body for this request is optional and default values are used if missing.

Build the request URL by replacing the `{entity}` and `{record_id}` variables in the `record` endpoint URL template.

#### Content

<props.properties>

- **`version`** <props.pill>object</props.pill> _optional_

  - Version-specific properties:

    <props.properties>

    - **`parent_hash`** <props.pill href="deae588f#versionhash">VersionHash</props.pill> _optional_

      - Hash of the record version to delete.

      - Defaults to the most recent version if missing.

    - **`created_at`** <props.pill href="deae588f#recorddate">RecordDate</props.pill> _optional_

      - Deletion date.

      - Defaults to the current date if missing.

    </props.properties>

- **`no_content`** <props.pill>object</props.pill> _optional_

  - Deletion options:

    <props.properties>

    - **`action`** <props.pill>enum</props.pill> _optional_

      - Type of deletion to perform:

        - `delete`: Standard deletion, propagated to others.

        - `local`: Only delete from the user's server, not propagated.

        - `leave`: Remove our user without deleting for others.

      - Defaults to `delete` if missing.

    </props.properties>

</props.properties>

#### Parameters

<props.properties>

- **`include_links`** <props.pill>string[]</props.pill> _optional_

  - Paths of links to include in the response (comma-separated).

  - Supports the following special values:

    - `entity`: Entity records for all entity links.

    - `existential`: All records for existential record links.

  - Defaults to `entity,existential`.

</props.properties>

#### Notes

- Optimistic concurrency can be achieve by providing `version.parent_hash`: the request will fail if another version was published in the meantime.

- This endpoint is idempotent if the following properties are provided:

  <props.compactList>

  - `version.parent_hash`

  - `version.created_at`

  </props.compactList>

- This endpoint is atomic and the record is guaranteed to be visible in all other queries once the request completes.

### Response

#### Content

<props.properties>

- **`record`** <props.pill href="01735953">Record</props.pill>

  - Deleted record, with [`no_content`](01735953#recordnocontent) property.

- **`linked_records`** <props.pill href="01735953">Record[]</props.pill>

  - Linked records requested with `include_links`.

</props.properties>

## Usage

### Delete a record

No request body is necessary to delete a record, this is enough:

```http
DELETE /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

The server creates the tombstone for the record and returns it.

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "record": {
    "author": {
      "entity": "alice.baq.run"
    },
    "id": "867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87",
    "source": "self",
    "created_at": "2024-03-05T16:50:17.9080000Z",
    "received_at": "2024-03-05T16:50:20.4850000Z",
    "version": {
      "author": {
        "entity": "alice.baq.run"
      },
      "hash": "72109e3b0b448c906700b51f580f0c9b77dbb228d87213fbd35f41fc97b77c5b",
      "created_at": "2024-03-07T01:39:03.1640000Z",
      "received_at": "2024-03-07T01:39:05.5050000Z",
      "parent_hash": "563bebcafec0aea26d88384564d721b3026b27a42263200f7aee09366763630d"
    },
    "permissions": {
      "read": "public"
    },
    "type": {
      "entity": "alice.baq.run",
      "record_id": "6ee7f69a90154b849bac528daa942bcd",
      "version_hash": "93ca1149e00ab963ea4b29772769e20330c356bb4b6ae787d3af9168e81d1687"
    },
    "no_content": {
      "action": "delete",
      "links": []
    }
  },
  "linked_records": []
}
```

### Locally delete a record

Deleting a record requires write permissions. But there are cases when we might want to remove a record from view regardless. By adding `action: local` we instruct the server to only delete the record from our user's feed. Other parties are not notified of this.

```http
DELETE /api/alice/records/paul.baq.run/dc730efaeac648eb956ccbebc2605bc9 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "no_content": {
    "action": "local"
  }
}
```

### Leave a record

We might sometimes want to be removed from a record's permissions in order to avoid receiving future updates. This can be done even when our user does not have write permissions on that record.

By adding `action: leave` we instruct the server to delete the record from our user's feed, and to notify other parties to remove our user's entity from the record's permissions.

```http
DELETE /api/alice/records/paul.baq.run/dc730efaeac648eb956ccbebc2605bc9 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "no_content": {
    "action": "leave"
  }
}
```

### Optimistic concurrency control

To make sure we're not deleting a record that changed since the last time we fetched it, we can explicitly specify `parent_hash`. The request will now fail if the record was updated in the meantime.

```http
DELETE /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "version": {
    "parent_hash": "563bebcafec0aea26d88384564d721b3026b27a42263200f7aee09366763630d"
  }
}
```
