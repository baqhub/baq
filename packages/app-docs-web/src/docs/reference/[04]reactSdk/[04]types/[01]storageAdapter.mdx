# StorageAdapter

This is an interface to give the SDK the ability to persist authentication data.

{props.toc}

## Reference

### `StorageAdapter`

Provides functions to read and write to a persistent storage medium.

#### Properties

<props.properties>

- **`type`** <props.pill>enum</props.pill>

  - Type of storage.

    - `"standard"`: General-purpose storage.
    - `"secure"`: Storage suitable for sensitive data.

- **<props.code>getString(key: <props.pill>key</props.pill>)</props.code>**: <props.pill>Promise\<string | undefined\></props.pill>

  - Read a string value from persistent storage for the given key.

  - Returns `undefined` if no value could be found.

- **<props.code>setString(key: <props.pill>key</props.pill>, value: <props.pill>key</props.pill>)</props.code>**: <props.pill>Promise</props.pill>

  - Store a string value to persistent storage for the given key.

  - If a value already exists for this key, the new value overwrites it.

- **<props.code>removeString(key: <props.pill>key</props.pill>)</props.code>**: <props.pill>Promise</props.pill>

  - Remove a string value from persistent storage for the given key.

  - Does not fail if no key to remove was found.

</props.properties>

### `localStorageAdapter`

A `StorageAdapter` implementation that uses the browser's [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API.

Available in the [`@baqhub/sdk-react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baqhub/sdk-react-dom) package.

```jsx
import {localStorageAdapter} from "@baqhub/sdk-react-dom";
```

### `asyncStorageAdapter`

A `StorageAdapter` implementation that uses React Native's [`AsyncStorage`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage).

Available in the [`@baqhub/sdk-react-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baqhub/sdk-react-native) or [`@baqhub/sdk-expo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baqhub/sdk-expo) packages.

```jsx
import {asyncStorageAdapter} from "@baqhub/sdk-react-native";
```

### `secureStorageAdapter`

A secure `StorageAdapter` implementation that uses [Expo SecureStore](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/).

Available in the [`@baqhub/sdk-expo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baqhub/sdk-expo) package.

```jsx
import {secureStorageAdapter} from "@baqhub/sdk-expo";
```

## Usage

### Store authentication data

To use the SDK's [built-in authentication flow](00491e8c), a storage adapter is necessary to persist the user's entity record, application record, and private key. The various `StorageAdapter` implementations make it possible to adapt to different platforms and requirements.

In this example of an Expo React Native app we provide a storage adapter for the SDK to store the records it needs to persist, and a different one to store the user's private key.

```jsx
import {buildAuthentication} from "../baq/authentication.js";
import {
  asyncStorageAdapter,
  secureStorageAdapter,
} from "@baqhub/sdk-expo";

const {useAuthentication} = buildAuthentication({
  storage: asyncStorageAdapter,
  secureStorage: secureStorageAdapter,
});
```
