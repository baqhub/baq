# useRecordQuery

This is a React hook to dynamically get a single record from a query.

```jsx
const {record} = useRecordQuery({filter: {...}});
```

{props.toc}

## Reference

### `useRecordQuery()`

Call `useRecordQuery` at the top level of your component to get a record back.

```jsx
function ThemePreference() {
  const {isLoading, record} = useRecordQuery({
    filter: queryType(AppPreferencesRecord),
  });

  if (isLoading || !record) {
    // Render fallback.
  }

  return <div>Theme: {record.content.theme}</div>;
}
```

#### Parameters

<props.properties>

- **`query`** <props.pill href="/todo">RecordQuery</props.pill>

  - Query to run against the store and user's server.

- **`options`** <props.pill href="#userecordqueryoptions">UseRecordQueryOptions</props.pill> _optional_

  - Advanced controls over the behavior of the hook.

</props.properties>

#### Returns

This hook returns a [`UseRecordQueryResult`](#userecordqueryresult) object.

#### Notes

- The hook only returns a record if the query matches one and only one record.

- A matching record may be returned immediately while the request is in flight.

- If in `fetch` (default) or `sync` mode, a persistent connection to the user's server ensures realtime record updates.

- Proxied queries are not supported.

### `UseRecordQueryOptions`

<props.properties>

- **`mode`** <props.pill>enum</props.pill> _optional_

  - Control the behavior of the hook.

    - `"fetch"` _default_ : Perform the query and listen for realtime updates after that.
    - `"sync"`: Only listen for realtime updates without performing the initial query.
    - `"local"`: Only query the local store.
    - `"local-tracked"`: Only query the local store and mark this query as "loaded".

</props.properties>

### `UseRecordQueryResult`

<props.properties>

- **`isLoading`** <props.pill>boolean</props.pill>

  - Whether the query is currently being performed.

- **`error`** <props.pill href="/todo">BaqError</props.pill> _optional_

  - An error that happened while performing the query, if any.

- **`record`** <props.pill href="/todo">Record</props.pill> _optional_

  - Resulting record, if found.

    The record is updated when a new version is fetched/received.

- **`deferredRecord`** <props.pill href="/todo">Record</props.pill> _optional_

  - Same as `record` but when the `query` changes it only gets updated after the request completes. This is helpful to keep the previous view on screen while loading new data.

- **`getRecord`** <props.pill href="/todo">() => Record | undefined</props.pill>

  - Same as `record`, but compatible with [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

    This function throws a promise while the request is in flight.

    The promise completes when the response is received.

- **`getDeferredRecord`** <props.pill href="/todo">() => Record | undefined</props.pill>

  - Same as `deferredRecord`, but compatible with [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

</props.properties>

## Usage

### Listen for future changes

The `useRecordQuery` hook makes it simple to keep the user interface in sync with changes happening on the server or elsewhere in the app.

In this example we display the status of a subscription to another user's public Post records. Subscription records are unique for a given publisher/type, and this hook can be used to check if a subscription record exists for a given combination.

The component will update automatically to display the correct status if a subscription record is created or deleted, either locally or remotely.

```jsx
import {Q, SubscriptionRecord} from "@baqhub/sdk";
import {useRecordQuery} from "./baq/store.js";
import {PostRecord} from "./baq/postRecord.js";

function SubscriptionStatus({publisherEntity}) {
  const {isLoading, record} = useRecordQuery({
    filter: Q.and(
      Q.type(SubscriptionRecord),
      Q.author(entity),
      Q.entity("content.publisher", publisherEntity),
      Q.record("content.recordType", PostRecord.link)
    ),
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Loading />;
  }

  const isSubscribed = Boolean(record);
  const statusText = isSubscribed ? "Subscribed" : "Unsubscribed";

  return <div>Status: {statusText}</div>;
}
```

### Fetch a single record by ID

There are multiple hooks to get a single record from the store. But when it's a record that might not be in the store yet, `useRecordQuery` is a convenient way to fetch it and keep it updated from that moment on.

In this example we fetch a Todo record using its [Key](4b9504a7#recordkey) (entity + id) and we display its title. If the record is already in the store, it will be displayed right away without an intermediate loading screen.

```jsx
import {Query} from "@baqhub/sdk";
import {useRecordQuery} from "./baq/store.js";

function Todo({todoKey}) {
  const {isLoading, record} = useRecordQuery(
    Query.ofKey(postKey)
  );

  if (!record && isLoading) {
    return <Loading />;
  }

  if (!record) {
    return <NotFound />;
  }

  return <div>Todo: {record.content.title}</div>;
}
```
