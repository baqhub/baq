# Welcome BAQ

After years in the making, it is with great pleasure today that I'm announcing the launch of **BAQ**, **the federated app platform**.

It's a set of protocols and tools that enables developers to build connected apps with little to no backend infrastructure while allowing end users to be in control of their own data. Whether you have an idea for a new personal productivity tool, a flashy new app to text your friends, or the social network of the future, you can go ahead and [build it on BAQ](9ab92fc0).

## Return to form

It used to be that as users of computers we were in charge of the files inside. We could choose what apps to open our documents with, what songs to copy on a drive to show our friends, and what photos to archive for safekeeping.

It used to be that as developers we could create apps freely, without having to ask permission from any "store" or fight for API access to walled gardens.

With the advent of the internet and as computers moved into our pockets, we've increasingly moved to online services that promised convenience and ubiquitous access to our data while ultimately delivering a fragmented, closed-off experience and taking away the control and choice we previously had.

As more and more of our lives take place online, BAQ is an attempt to reclaim that lost freedom. It's a vision for an internet where real competition is possible by empowering us all to make two essential choices:

1. _**Who do we trust to host our data**_.
2. _**What apps do we want to use to create and consume that data**_.

Everyone should be able to make these decisions for themselves with the confidence that they can always change their minds later on, and that it won't affect their ability to communicate with the people they hold dear.

## Available today

## Acknowledgements

BAQ was in large parts inspired by the [Tent protocol](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/tent-open-distributed-social-networking-protocol/2012/10/02) and its vision for a new kind of federated web back in 2012. I'm extremely grateful to the Tent team for their enthusiasm and groundbreaking ideas, many of which made it into the BAQ protocol as it exists today.
