# Using the HTTP API

The BAQ HTTP API is how apps communicate with servers, and how servers communicate with one another. It returns data in JSON format and follows familiar REST principles.

{props.toc}

## Discovery

To start interacting with a BAQ server, we need to find the endpoints it exposes. This is done through the [discovery process](15c9fa81) that makes it possible to find a user's server from their entity.

#### Step 1

Perform a [HEAD request](15c9fa81) on the entity to discover:

```http
HEAD / HTTP/2
Host: alice.baq.run
```

This returns a `Link` header with the URL of the user's [Entity record](375c4ea9):

```http
HTTP/2 204 No Content
Link: <https://baq.run/api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/529acdec9bcb48fc98c4be5271f0f698>; rel="https://baq.dev/rels/entity-record"
```

#### Step 2

Download the user's Entity record:

```http
GET /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/529acdec9bcb48fc98c4be5271f0f698 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "record": {
    "author": {"entity": "alice.baq.run"},
    "content": {
      "previous_entities": [],
      "profile": {
        "name": "Alice"
      },
      "servers": [
        {
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "preference": 0,
          "endpoints": {
            "auth": "https://baq.run/alice/auth/{record_id}",
            "records": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records",
            "record": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}",
            "record_versions": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}/versions",
            "record_version": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}/versions/{version_hash}",
            "new_record": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records",
            "record_blob": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}/blobs/{blob_hash}/{file_name}",
            "record_version_blob": "https://baq.run/api/alice/records/{entity}/{record_id}/versions/{version_hash}/blobs/{blob_hash}/{file_name}",
            "new_blob": "https://baq.run/api/alice/blobs",
            "events": "https://baq.run/api/alice/events",
            "new_notification": "https://baq.run/api/alice/notifications",
            "server_info": "https://baq.run/api/alice/server"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This contains basic profile information, along with the API endpoints to use to communicate with the user's server.

## Fetch public records

Public records can be fetched without any form of authentication through the [`records`](a29bdfea) or [`record`](e9aabfb6) endpoints. This comes in handy to display public content to any visitor, like for a blog or podcast.

The following request returns all public Task records from that user:

```http
GET /api/alice/records?filter=$['type']=types.baq.dev+fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "records": [...],
  "linked_records": [...]
}
```

## Authenticate

To get permission to access private records and create new records, the app needs to be authorized by the user.

#### Step 1

Register the app with the user's server by creating an app record. Here we have an app that requests permission to read and write all Task records for this user. We also send the public key of the credentials we'll use to sign requests in a separate HTTP header.

```http
POST /api/alice/records HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: BAQ ...
X-Baq-Credentials: algorithm="ed25519" public_key="yLRK/T3oCvqnLuEQ54yDgAgVU0+m772JeaJ0vlD45Mg="

{
  "name": "BAQ Todos",
  "uris": {
    "redirect": "https://tododemo.baq.dev/?authorization_id={authorization_id}",
    "website": "https://tododemo.baq.dev"
  },
  "scope_request": {
    "read": [
      {
        "entity": "types.baq.dev",
        "record_id": "fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128"
      }
    ],
    "write": [
      {
        "entity": "types.baq.dev",
        "record_id": "fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The server returns the newly created record. The record ID will be needed later on to sign authenticated requests. Server credentials are also included to verify the signature of server responses.

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Server-Authorization: BAQ ...
X-Baq-Credentials: algorithm="ed25519" public_key="INCrEeo0IjPtrSqqZlD2ukyM2bWrvjOE6ik1j1rO8as="

{
  "record": {
    "author": {
      "entity": "alice.baq.run"
    },
    "id": "4bae3e86828a44fc96b78cd0d5a4b7ae",
    ...
  },
  "linked_records": []
}
```

#### Step 2

Direct the user to the `auth` endpoint with the ID of the App record. This can be done within the current window for web apps, or by opening a browser window for desktop/mobile apps.

```
https://baq.run/alice/auth/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87
```

Once the user authorizes the app, they will be redirected back to the `redirect` URL from the App record with a unique authorization ID.

```
https://tododemo.baq.dev/?authorization_id=ab15b883b9f24d9dbd9d3cd3cda3707b
```

#### Step 3

We can now perform [authenticated requests](4d23cbf0) by using our private key to include a unique signature in the `Authorization` header.

```http
GET /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/430ed5e38a0c4002a62f81e497820c5c HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
X-Baq-Client-Id: 8fbf7696f25b4628bde73f46f4631d3f
Authorization: id="4bae3e86828a44fc96b78cd0d5a4b7ae" algorithm="ed25519" ts="1710884802348" nonce="573hf2jg" headers="x-baq-client-id" signature="wVdBX9VKGJHhWBWOwiT9NH5ELHgMYt36JFqN+aiPVbeCWyMT85KgjemVemKQxw2m0ZYMfsQ6kV92uraJkyUWCQ=="
```

## Fetch a record

A single record can be fetched through the [`record`](e9aabfb6) endpoint.

```http
GET /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "record": {
    "author": {
      "entity": "alice.baq.run"
    },
    "id": "867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87",
    ...
  },
  "linked_records": []
}
```

## Fetch a list of records

Multiple records can be retrieved in a single request through the [`records`](a29bdfea) endpoint. This pulls the entire collection of records available on the user's server in chronological order, but filters can be provided to narrow it down to the desired subset instead.

In this examples, records are filtered by `type` and `author` to only return Task records created by user `cyril.baq.run`:

```http
GET /api/alice/records?filter=$['type']=types.baq.dev+fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128,$['author']=cyril.baq.run HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "records": [...],
  "linked_records": [...]
}
```

## Fetch proxied records

The [`records`](a29bdfea) endpoint can also be used to fetch records from outside the user's server. This is done by indicating what entity to target with the `proxy_to` query param.

```http
GET /api/alice/records?query_to=cyril.baq.run HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```

This offers some advantages compared to a direct request:

- No need to perform discovery.

- It not only returns public records, but also private records that the user is authorized to access.

- It offers more consistent performance by making sure all requests are only to the user's own server (some servers may decide to cache results for greater availability).

## Create a new record

A new record is created with a request to the [`new_record`](d80a9260) endpoint.

In this example, we create a new private Task record:

```http
POST /api/alice/records HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": {
    "entity": "types.baq.dev",
    "record_id": "fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128",
    "version_hash": "2c2363602c496a6ac5d692c6332d246a8d4492d74ff4fe539ea15a36bec0e899"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "Buy more cookies!",
    "completed": false
  }
}
```

- The `id` and `created_at` properties can be added to [make the request idempotent](d80a9260#create-a-record-idempotently). If omitted, the server will provide values for both.

- This endpoint can also be used to [update](d80a9260) or [delete](d80a9260) a record.

## Update an existing record

While a record can be updated through the [`new_record`](d80a9260) endpoint, a PUT request to the [`record`](ee55634d) endpoint can also be used for convenience.

```http
PUT /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": {
    "title": "Buy more cookies!",
    "completed": true
  }
}
```

## Delete a record

While a record can be deleted through the [`new_record`](d80a9260) endpoint, a DELETE request to the [`record`](c6326f00) endpoint can also be used for convenience.

```http
DELETE /api/alice/records/alice.baq.run/867deccbe7ac4adca4efc07fbe08af87 HTTP/2
Host: baq.run
```
