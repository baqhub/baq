# Using the CLI

The BAQ CLI is an helpful tool to manage the record types used in your application, whether you choose to create them yourself or use existing ones.

{props.toc}

For a list of all commands see the [CLI reference](6bf5f232).

## Installation

The BAQ CLI is distributed as an NPM package. It can be installed globally:

```cli
npm install -g @baqhub/cli
baq help
```

Or locally within a project:

```cli
npm install -D @baqhub/cli
npx baq help
```

## Initialize a BAQ project

For the BAQ CLI to manage record types in an application, it needs a [project file](06fc3177). To create it, initialize a new project like this:

```cli
baq init
```

This command will prompt for the following questions:

- **Where should the project be created?**

  Point it towards the root folder of the app project.

- **What's the user-facing name of this project?**

  This is the name users will see when they authorize the app.

- **What type of project is this?**

  Different files will be generated depending on the project type.

- **Where should the project files live?**

  This is where auto-generated JS/TS files will be created.

After this, a `baq.json` file is created:

```json
{
  "name": "Cool BAQ app",
  "type": "ts-react",
  "path": "src/baq",
  "record_types": {}
}
```

This file can be updated with other [CLI commands](6bf5f232), or directly by hand.

## Import existing record types

Record types are BAQ records themselves and are identified by their author entity and record ID. A record type can be imported into the current project like this:

```cli
baq add types.baq.dev+fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128
```

This is a record type for a single task in a todo app and its intrinsic name `task` will be used by default. If needed, a different name can be specified during import:

```cli
baq add types.baq.dev+fe727f22b5c34fb185a370449e4f0128 todo
```

This will name it `todo` instead within the current project. This can be helpful to avoid conflicts, or for naming consistency within your app.

#### Remove a record type

When a record type is no longer needed it can be removed from the current project by its short name like this:

```cli
baq remove task
```

## Publish new record types

When a suitable record type does not already exist, it can be necessary to create and publish a new one. It starts by creating the JSON file with the record type definition:

```json
{
  "name": "task",
  "icon_name": "task_alt",
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "content": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "title": {
            "description": "Title of the task.",
            "type": "string",
            "max_length": 128
          },
          "completed": {
            "description": "Whether the task was completed.",
            "type": "boolean"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The record type can now be added to the project:

```cli
baq add src/types/task.json
```

This will track the local type in the project file, getting it ready for publication, and generate the corresponding code files.

#### Authentication

The record type needs to be published to a BAQ server before the app can be made publicly available. Authenticate the BAQ CLI with a server by providing an entity:

```cli
baq login username.host.com
```

This will open a browser window to complete the authentication flow and obtain a code that can then be copy/pasted to complete the process.

#### Publishing

All local record types can be published with a single command:

```cli
baq publish
```

This will create new records for newly created types, and update existing records for modified types.

## Rebuild code files

Whenever changes are made to the `baq.json` project file, or to local record type definitions, the corresponding auto-generated code files may need to be updated.

This can be triggered manually with:

```cli
baq
```

Or automatically every time a change is detected with:

```cli
baq watch
```
