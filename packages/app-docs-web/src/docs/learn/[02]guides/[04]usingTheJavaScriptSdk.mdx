# Using the JavaScript SDK

The BAQ JavaScript SDK provides abstractions and helpers that make it easier to work with BAQ records instead of having to directly interact with the [HTTP API](50c614b0).

{props.toc}

## Installation

The BAQ JavaScript SDK is distributed as an NPM package.

```cli
npm install @baqhub/sdk
```

## Define a record type

The schemas for record types are expressed using [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) to enable client-side validation of the data returned by servers and persisted locally.

The recommended way to define record types is to let the [BAQ CLI](6fd9977d) do it automatically based on a record type JSON definition. But it's also possible to do it by hand.

In this example, we define a `task` record type with a title and completion status.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import {IO, SchemaIO, RecordType, Record} from "@baqhub/sdk";

// Define the schema for the record content.
const RTaskRecordContent = SchemaIO.object({
  title: SchemaIO.string({maxLength: 128}),
  completed: SchemaIO.boolean(),
});

// Define the record type.
// These must match the published record type.
const [taskRecordType, RTaskRecordType] = RecordType.full(
  "baqtodotypes.baq.run",
  "8f37b56913fc4e739bc2f983b7eb70dd",
  "37463fd745d448068d0558a3225a26aa132626779b934f919b2e2f9757a38490",
  RTaskRecordContent
);

// Combine content schema and type to define the record.
const RTaskRecord = Record.io(
  taskRecordType,
  RTaskRecordType,
  RTaskRecordContent
);

// Export the record type object and type.
export interface TaskRecord extends IO.TypeOf<typeof RTaskRecord> {}
export const TaskRecord = Record.ioClean<TaskRecord>(RTaskRecord);
```

## Authenticate

Authentication is a 3-step process:

1. Register the app.

2. Direct the user to the authorization flow.

3. Build the authentication state with the resulting authorization ID.

Here, we use the record type we defined earlier to request permission to read and write task records.

```ts
import {Authentication} from "@baqhub/sdk";
import {TaskRecord} from "./taskRecord.js";

async function authenticate(entity: string) {
  //
  // Step 1: Register the app.
  //
  const {flowUrl, state} = await Authentication.register(entity, {
    name: "BAQ Todo",
    description: "Manage your daily tasks with ease.",
    uris: {
      website: "https://baqtodo.app",
      redirect: "https://baqtodo.app/auth{/authorization_id}",
    },
    scopeRequest: {
      read: [TaskRecord.link],
      write: [TaskRecord.link],
    },
  });

  //
  // Step 2: Direct the user to the authorization flow.
  //
  const authorizationId = await showFlowBrowser(flowUrl);

  //
  // Step 3: Combine the authorization ID and partial authentication state.
  //
  return Authentication.complete(state, authorizationId);
}
```

## Build a Client

Now that we have an authentication state, we can use it to build a [Client](e1ca2823) to fetch data and perform actions on behalf of our user.

```ts
import {Client, AuthenticationState} from "@baqhub/sdk";

const authState = await authenticate("https://alice.baq.run");
const client = Client.authenticated(authState);
```

The state can also be persisted in JSON form to be re-used in between sessions.

```ts
import {Client, AuthenticationState} from "@baqhub/sdk";

const authStateJson = localStorage.getItem("auth_state");
const authState = AuthenticationState.decodeJSON(authStateJson);
const client = Client.authenticated(authState);
```

When only wanting to query public records, an unauthenticated client can be created with just the user's entity:

```ts
const client = Client.ofEntity("https://alice.baq.run");
```
