# Thinking with records

BAQ apps model their data with records and may be designed differently than traditional centralized web apps or isolated desktop/mobile apps.

Let's look at different BAQ apps and see how they're architected.

## Guiding principles

- Take advantage of built-in BAQ features (links, subscriptions...).

- Use BAQ to store as much of an app's data as possible. This makes for a greater user experience when moving from device to device.

- Re-use popular types everywhere it makes sense. This creates a virtuous cycle where apps benefit from one another.

## Messages app
