# Thinking with records

BAQ apps model their data with records and may be designed differently than traditional centralized web apps or isolated desktop/mobile apps.

Let's look at different BAQ apps and see how they're architected.

{props.toc}

## Guiding principles

- Take advantage of built-in platform features (links, subscriptions...).

- Use BAQ to store as much of an app's data as possible. This makes for a greater user experience when moving from device to device.

- Re-use popular types everywhere it makes sense. This creates a virtuous cycle where apps benefit from one another.

## Files app

This is a file hosting service with a hierarchy of folders and files.

![Files app data model.](modelAppFiles)

It uses two record types:

- **Folder** : Record with a name and optionally a parent folder.

- **File** : Record that links to a blob with the file content, and optionally a parent folder.

Queries:

- _**Root folder** :_ Find all Folder or File records with no parent link.

- _**Other folder** :_ Find all Folder or File records that have that record as parent.

Notes:

- By marking the `parent` link as `existential`, deleting a folder will also delete all downstream content.

A live version of the app can be found at [files.baq.dev](https://files.baq.dev) ([source](https://github.com/baqhub/baq/tree/main/packages/app-files-web))

## Messages app

This is an instant-messaging service with either 1:1 or group conversations.

![Messages app data model.](modelAppMessages)

It uses two record types:

- **Conversation** : Record that defines the participants of the conversation through its permissions. Also includes an optional title.

- **Message** : Record with the text content of the message a link to the conversation it belongs to and optional links to another message when replying, and to any number of blobs for images.

Queries:

- _**Conversation list** :_ The `distinct` parameter can be used to list the last message for each conversation. The corresponding conversation can be returned in the same request by adding the `include_links` parameter.

- _**Message list** :_ List all messages that link to the selected conversation, sorted by `received_at` descending.

A live version of the app can be found at [messages.baq.dev](https://messages.baq.dev) ([source](https://github.com/baqhub/baq/tree/main/packages/app-messages-web))

## Bird app

This is a micro-blogging service with support for text, mentions, and images.

![Bird app data model.](modelAppBird)

It uses two record types:

- **Post** : Record with text content and optional links to other users for mentions, to other posts for re-posts and replies, and to any number of blobs for images.

- **Subscription** : Built-in record that makes it possible to automatically receive public posts from a given user.

Queries:

- _**Feed** :_ List all post records filtered by `source`.

- _**Mentions** :_ List post records that have mention links to the user.

- _**User publications** :_ List post records by author, proxy to the target user.

- _**Followings** :_ List subscription records filtered by author.

- _**Followers** :_ List subscription records filtered by publisher.

A live version of the app can be found at [bird.baq.dev](https://bird.baq.dev) ([source](https://github.com/baqhub/baq/tree/main/packages/app-bird-web))
