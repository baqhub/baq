# Build your first app

No better way to learn than to get our hands dirty and build a BAQ app from scratch.

In this guide we will be building a task-management web application that follows the familiar [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) design but connects to a BAQ server to store data and synchronize between clients.

Here's what our app will look like by the time we're done:
