# Find a server

The first step into the world of BAQ is to get a server that will communicate with other servers and host data for all the apps your use.

Choice of server can be based on preferences for pricing, geographical location, policies, and so on. It's always possible to change your mind and move to another server later on. For the more adventurous, self-hosting is of course an option.

## Public servers

- **[BAQ.RUN](https://baq.run)** â€“ The first commercial BAQ service. Designed for privacy and reliability. Get started in no time with a free account.

## Self-host

_Coming soon, see [the BAQ roadmap](6e4376bd)._

The open-source BAQ server is designed for people to host their own personal server on the infrastructure of their choosing. It's the ultimate solution for those who want full control, but requires more technical know-how to run. Developers can also find it convenient to use for development and testing.
