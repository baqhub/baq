# 1. Setup the project

In this guide we will be creating the project folder and installing the necessary dependencies.

{props.toc}

## Scaffold the project

For this application we've decided on a popular and familiar set of technologies to make it easier to get started.

<props.compactList>

- **Vite** – Bundler, dev server.

- **React** – UI framework.

- **TypeScript** – Type-checking.

</props.compactList>

Let's get started by scaffolding our new project with the help of the Vite creation tool:

```cli
npm create vite@latest baqtodos --template react-swc-ts
```

We use the `react-swc-ts` template so that everything is ready for us to use React and TypeScript and we should already be able to run our bare-bones app:

```cli
cd baqtodos
npm i
npm run dev
```

The app should now be reachable at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Install dependencies

While we could communicate with a BAQ server by making HTTP requests with the Fetch API, we instead rely on the following packages to hit the ground running and save significant time.

- **`@baqhub/sdk`**: Core SDK to authenticate against a BAQ server and create, update, and query records.

- **`@baqhub/sdk-react`**: React hooks and components to help build BAQ apps that update when the underlying data changes.

- **`@baqhub/sdk-react-dom`**: Browser-specific logic to store and retrieve persistent data in between sessions.

- **`@baqhub/cli`**: Command-line utility to manage the record types (i.e. schema or data model) used in the app.

We will also install the `todomvc-app-css` package with all the CSS we'll need so that we can focus on the inner-workings of the app rather than its design.

Install everything:

```cli
npm i @baqhub/sdk @baqhub/sdk-react @baqhub/sdk-react-dom @baqhub/cli todomvc-app-css
```

## Remove unneeded content

Finally, we clean up the Vite template by removing everything that won't be of use for what we're building:

```cli
rm src/App.css
rm src/index.css
rm src/assets/react.svg
```

Replace everything in `App.tsx` to remove the default content:

```tsx
import {FC} from "react";

export const App: FC = () => {
  return null;
};
```

Update references in `main.tsx`:

```diff-tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
-import App from "./App.tsx";
-import "./index.css";
+import {App} from "./App.tsx";

+import "todomvc-app-css/index.css";
```

And update the app title in `index.html`:

```diff-html
<head>
  ...
-  <title>Vite + React + TS</title>
+  <title>BAQ Todos</title>
</head>
```

## Next step

We're now done setting up our project.
