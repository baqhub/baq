# Roadmap

The BAQ platform already supports many types of apps today, but we're excited to bring new features and tools to enable developers to do even more in the future.

## Shipped: Q1 2025

- **SDK — Infinite loading**

  Update the [`useRecordsQuery()`](fb201974) hook to make it easy to load more data.

- **Protocol — Standing record**

  Automatically quarantine private records from unknown senders. Introduce the [Standing record](e7679293) to manage the quarantine status.


## In progress

- **ActivityPub bridge**

  Follow people in the Fediverse and get followed back. With support for mentions, replies, re-posts, and rich media.

- **Protocol — Federation**

  Federation has been part of the protocol design from the start, but it needs documenting and public federation needs to be enabled on [BAQ.RUN](https://baq.run).

- **Protocol — Standard error codes**

  Publish an exhaustive specification of all the possible error codes that the API endpoints can return and their meaning.

- **Protocol — Rate limiting**

  Standardize the way servers should rate limit, and let the SDK automatically backoff and retry when needed.

- **Protocol — Default values in Schemas**

  Let BAQ Schemas specify default values for JSON properties. This will also make it possible to add new required properties when publishing new versions of a schema.

## Short term

_In the next few months:_

- **Protocol — Sidecar records**

  Attach a record to another and fetch both together. This makes it possible to extend popular record types without losing compatibility.

- **Protocol — Record conditions**

  Add conditions in record types to enforce more constraints upon creation of the corresponding records.

- **Protocol — Counters**

  Specify what needs to be counted and aggregated within BAQ schemas, and instantly fetch the current values when needed.

- **Protocol — Multipart blob upload**

  Make it easier to upload larger blobs to a BAQ server by allowing parts of a file to be uploaded separately.

- **Protocol — Account migration**

  Let users move freely from one server to another without losing any of their data, apps, or connections.

- **Protocol — Content filters**

  Filter records by the nature of their content. Already possible on a per-app basis, but this will make it standard. Same for content warnings.

- **Tooling — Open-source server**

  Single-user, open-source server that can be deployed for self-hosting or used during development to run apps locally or in CD/CI.

- **Tooling — Server test suite**

  Full integration test suite to validate BAQ servers. Used against [BAQ.RUN](https://baq.run) and the development server. Required for federation.

- **SDK — Offline-first**

  Build offline-first apps using the JS SDK. This will handle local data storage, garbage collection, re-sync on launch, and so on.

- **Files app — Basic features**

  Make it possible to share files and folders, display thumbnails, preview files directly. Release a mobile app.

- **Messages app — Group chats**

  Add group chat support with the ability to name a specific group, add/remove people over time, and leave unwanted groups.

- **Bird app — Android support**

  Make the mobile app available to Android users.

## Medium term

_In the next few years:_

- **Tooling — Record type registry**

  Think NPM for record types. Make it easy to find popular record types and add them to an app in a click.

- **SDK — Native support**

  iOS and Android native SDKs, with more platforms to follow. Let more people build on BAQ!

- **Protocol — User groups**

  Add groups of users to the record permissions. Groups can be updated down the road to grant or remove access.

- **Protocol — Search**

  Some advanced search use-cases may always need to be handled at the app level, or by 3rd party engines. But basic search needs to be standard.

- **Protocol — Real-time collaboration**

  Enable instant collaborative editing through built-in CRDTs without the need for any app-specific server infrastructure.

- **Protocol — E2E encryption**

  Support end-to-end encryption and make it as simple as a flag when creating any type of record.

- **Protocol — Payments**

  Support purchases, subscriptions, micro-transactions, and attention-based payments. Simplify the online shopping experience once and for all.

- **Protocol — Propagation scaling**

  Update the protocol as the BAQ network grows to support the distribution of records to millions of servers and followers.

- **Files app — Desktop sync**

  Desktop client to seamlessly synchronize entire folders in the background with the Files app.

- **Messages app — Mobile apps**

  Rich messaging clients for the two major mobile platforms.

- **Notes app**

  Take your notes with you everywhere, safely stored on your BAQ server.

- **Photos app**

  Reclaim your photos and keep these precious memories under your control.

## Long term

- **Hardware IoT platform**

  Build connected devices for consumers without worrying about pairing new hardware, authenticating users, and synchronizing state.

- **Operating system**

  What if every app you ran stored their data as BAQ records? And what if the OS itself acted as a gigantic local cache? And what if everything was always in sync between your devices? Come dream of the future with us!
